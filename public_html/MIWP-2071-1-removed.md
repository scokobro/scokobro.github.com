Some general advice: Experience has taught me that it is unwise to rely on 'the internet'; if you are intending to use any resource in your presentation (images, video, the slides themselves) which is online, make sure you have a locally-stored backup copy to hand... just in case!

Also, if anyone wants to use my computer for their presentation be aware that it's a Mac and that Mac's version of PowerPoint can mess up complicated slide formatting if the slides have been prepared on a PC, or if they make use of 'unusual' (i.e. not available on a Mac) fonts.

## Final Presentation ##

Presentations will be held in weeks 14 and 15, I haven't decided exactly how long they will need to be (probably 12-15mins) but I'll let you know soon. Please check your groups and get in touch if you want to make any changes; if you want to change groups and can find someone to swap with then let me know.

**Just to confirm: the topic of the presentation is up to you, so when you have discussed this in your groups please let me know. **
